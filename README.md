Remedial Programming Class
==========================

Branch to play along from home.

Class Activities
----------------

Each week or so, we'll start with a basic outline of a data structure with some test data we can play with.

A basic guideline of what methods should be implemented will be given. For the most part I plan on following the STL for most of my implementations.

Branch the code, fill in your implementation, write some tests, etc. At the end of the week anyone who's interested can get together and talk about how it went, and award arbitrary points for arbitrary accomplishments. We can then come up with challenges for the next week.

Since we don't have any challenges set for the first week, I encourage discussing possible challenges now.

Lesson Plan
-----------

Week 1: Arrays and Sorting

Week 2: Binary Trees and Balancing

Week 3: Hashes and Bucketing

Week 4: Strings and Chunking

Week 5: Functionality and Link Listing
